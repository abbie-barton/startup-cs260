  "description": "When I was young, my diet consisted mostly of mac and cheese, toast, or packaged meals. As I grew up, my family and I realized that eating that way is not very healthy. We started looking for recipes that were healthy and tasted good, and slowly we started building up a binder of family recipes. Now, the binder is broken and greasy and starting to lose pages. I want to make a recipe website for my family so that our collection of recipes is safe and can grow bigger than our binder.",
